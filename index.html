        <h1>Welcome to my first ever webpage!</h1>

        <p>This page is a basic webpage for <strong>SML5202</strong>: <em> Computers and languages</em> module</p>

        <h2>A little about me</h2>
        <h3>Student Life</h3>
        <p>I am a French and Linguistics student at <strong><abbr
                    itle="Queen Mary University of London">QMUL</abbr></strong>.</p>

        <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <h4>Coding</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>Python</h5>
                <p>The first language I learned was <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. This is one of if not
                    the best
                    ython tutorials available on the internet.</p>

            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h5>Swift</h5>
                <p>Python is great but I much prefer <a href="https://swift.org/">Swift</a>. This is Mainly because of
                    the following reasons.</p>

                <ol>
                    <p>Swift is:</p>
                    <li>Type Safe</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>it has great type inference</li>
                        <li>it prevents all classes of programming errors to do with dynamic typed languages</li>
                        <li>it has optionals to ensure that any data that may not have a value is dealt with easily</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Modern</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>it has features like Generics, Closures, Protocols and extensions on custom and builtin
                            types. It also recently added support for async/await</li>
                        <li>it is open sourced with feature proposals being reviewed every day and new versions being
                            released every year</li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <li>Fast (well Swift rather)
                        <ul>
                            <li>It checks code at compile time helping devs to code faster and prevent runtime errors
                            </li>
                            <li>it has a incredibly fast runtime and can run along side existing C, C++ and Objective-C
                                code
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Music</h4>
        <p>When I'm not coding I also make music. I can produce, record, sing, write, mix and master songs.</p>
